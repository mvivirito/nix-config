  # Host-specific home-manager configuration for nixos-laptop

  # This file is for laptop-specific user configurations
  # Examples:
  # - Monitor configurations (if different from shared defaults)
  # - Laptop-specific packages or services
  # - Performance/battery optimizations

  # Currently empty - all home-manager config is shared
  # Add laptop-specific overrides here as needed
